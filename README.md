# Image reconstruction and novel view synthesis represent an active area of research and various techniques have been presented over the years with varying degrees of success. One of the most recent and state-of-the-art techniques is Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) which uses the weights of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. The applications of these models can be found in photo-editing, 3D surface extraction, and large/city-scale 3D representation. Pakistan is home to one of the most visually diverse tourist attractions in the world. The promotion and marketing of these national attractions come at the expense of traveling costs and expensive equipment. We present a system that takes in a sparse set of views of popular tourist locations across Pakistan as input and converts them into 3D models using NeRF, eliminating the need for funds. These 3D views will then be integrated into a browser, allowing users to experience said locations in an immersive way remotely, promoting tourist attractions and ultimately resulting in the growth of the tourism industry of Pakistan.
